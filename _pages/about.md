## about

I am a Staff Software Engineer at Google, USA working on profile guided optimizations for datacenter workloads. My current work focuses on profile guided optimizations for heap allocation in non-moving memory allocators. I'm interested in hardware-software co-design and participate in the [RISC-V CTR TG](https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-control-transfer-records) discussion. I partner with academic researchers and have served on the program committee of [CGO](https://conf.researchr.org/profile/conf/snehasishkumar). Previously, my work on [code layout](https://groups.google.com/g/llvm-dev/c/RUegaMg-iqc/m/wFAVxa6fCgAJ) was featured on [Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Machine-Function-Splitter) and discussed on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24437459). As part of a larger team, I worked on [Propeller](https://groups.google.com/g/llvm-dev/c/ef3mKzAdJ7U/m/1shV64BYBAAJ), a post-link optimization framework. An [academic paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub52144/) describing our work was awarded distinguished paper at [ASPLOS 2023](https://asplos-conference.org/2023/#:~:text=Propeller%3A%20A%20Profile%20Guided%2C%20Relinking%20Optimizer%20for%20Warehouse%20Scale%20Applications). 


## academic research

As a PhD student I worked with the Architecture Research Group at Simon Fraser University advised by [Dr. Arrvindh Shriraman](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ashriram/). I was also supervised by [Dr. Nick Sumner](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~wsumner/) and interned with [Dr. Viji Srinivasan](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-viji) at IBM. My research can be broadly described as generalized methods for application specific hardware specialization. I have worked on cache memory systems, coherence protocols, workload characterization and application specific hardware specialization. The semiconductor industry specializes hardware for better performance and energy efficiency, but this creates challenges in deciding what to specialize and how to integrate specialized units. Current methods require manual effort to restructure workloads. My research focuses on automated compiler techniques for specialization. I've developed program analysis techniques to address the problem and synthesized an accelerator workload suite to help researchers. My work is available as open-source software. I've also researched ways to reduce energy consumption from data movement and designed adaptive caching mechanisms. My academic research has been published at the following conferences: 
 *HPCA'18, HPCA'17, IISWC'16, MICRO'16, ICS'16, ISCA'15, ICS'15, ISCA'13, MICRO'12*.
